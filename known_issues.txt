Room for improvement:
=====================

JbToken is too heavy - subclassing can be used for for 
1) fixed text tokens
2) line & col can be but into a single int

Smart CharSequence

Line endings

StringBufferInputStream in test

I18N

Modules

var, map, reduce should not be keywords

consider diagnostics that contain start end end, not only a single point

Error message concerning duplicate variable should have child that points to the previous declaration
UI: stopping interpreter or AST builder now does not work
UI: hyperlinks from output window

minor issues that however should be fixed:
------------------------------------------

- non integer power
- strings and char sequences
